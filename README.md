As a part of my education at Educom, I have created a Vacancy-website called Vac!t as a case study. I have used Symfony and PHP to generate a site where Candidates can register, update their profile and apply to numerous technology related jobs. Employers can post jobs on Vac!t and receive an overview of all applicants per job, which they can invite for an interview with a simple click.

## Technologies used

* **HTML & CSS**
* **Javascript/Json**
* **Foundation**
* **Symfony**
* **AJAX**
* **SimpleUpload Library**
* **PHP**
* **Vegas.JS**
* **PhpMyAdmin**
* **Sweet Alert**
* **Twig**


I found it especially fun working with all the listed technologies but I feel that some deserve honorable mentions:

* I enjoyed implementing AJAX to show pictures on the screen as they are uploaded by users.
* I had a lot of fun creating different permissions for different logged in users (Candidate, Employer, Admin) and showing different pages or buttons based on who is logged in.
* I enjoyed error handling or handling pages with insufficient access privilege with the use of Sweet Alert.
* I enjoyed using Vegas.JS to loop through all of my vacancies and their icons to show them on my home page.

All in all, I am proud to present to you the result of my work!


## Methods & Techniques

### Planning & Github Projects

Before any lines of code were written, I made a point of it to ensure that my organization and planning were on par to streamline my workflow. To do so, I first mapped out all of my functions from Controller to Entity and put all of these functions in a Github Project. This ensured that I could focus entirely on one function at a time and give myself deadlines. I am confident that this increased my productivity significantly and am continuously aiming to improve the process and do it better every time.
